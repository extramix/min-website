            <p class="is-size-5 ">My name is Sirapat Jariyanantakul. You can call me Mix. I'm 18 years old student
                who are interested in technology and coding. I started coding when I was 17 years old with C# language with Unity game engine.
                It was really difficult to digest new concepts into my head. But it turned to be fun after just 2 months of watching tutorials and started to build my own game.</p>
                <p class="is-size-5">after that game project was done, I looked into web development area and I find myself enjoy it. So, I started learning HTML,CSS and JavaScript then continued to JavaScript framework like Angular.</p>
